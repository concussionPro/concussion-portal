## Module 1: What is a Concussion? (60s)

**[VISUAL: Brain animation with force vectors]**

"Welcome to Module 1: What is a Concussion?

A concussion isn't just a bump on the head—it's a complex neurometabolic crisis happening at the cellular level. When rotational forces cause the brain to move within the skull, a cascade of ionic flux and energy depletion begins.

Over the next 45 minutes, you'll explore the biomechanics, the pathophysiology, and the risk factors that determine why identical impacts can have vastly different outcomes.

This isn't textbook theory. This is the foundation of every clinical decision you'll make—from your initial assessment to return-to-play clearance.

You'll master the science through interactive infographics, clinical flowcharts, and knowledge checks embedded throughout the module. No boring lectures. Just the evidence you need to practice confidently.

Ready? Let's dive in."

## Module 2: Concussion Diagnosis & Initial Assessment (60s)

**[VISUAL: Sideline assessment scene, SCAT6 tools]**

"Module 2: Concussion Diagnosis and Initial Assessment.

You're pitchside. An athlete takes a hard hit. What's your systematic approach?

This module arms you with the assessment protocols used by every professional sports medicine team in Australia—SCAT6, VOMS, BESS, cranial nerve screening, and cervical differentiation tests.

You'll learn when to call emergency services, how to identify subtle neurological deficits, and why cervical spine assessment is non-negotiable in concussion management.

Interactive flowcharts guide you through on-field decision-making. Quick knowledge checks test your clinical reasoning. Visual infographics break down complex assessment tools into actionable steps.

By the end, you'll have a reproducible system for every suspected concussion—from junior footy to professional sport.

This is 90 minutes of evidence-based clinical tools. Let's get started."

## Module 3: Practical Assessment & Acute Concussion Management (60s)

**[VISUAL: Clinical examination, real patient scenarios]**

"Module 3: Practical Assessment and Acute Concussion Management.

Assessment tools are useless without clinical integration. This module puts everything into practice.

You'll work through real case scenarios—the footballer with persistent dizziness, the cyclist with visual symptoms, the patient whose 'concussion' is actually cervicogenic headache.

Learn the acute management protocols that reduce symptom burden and prevent complications. Master the graduated return-to-activity framework used across Australian sports medicine.

Interactive decision trees guide you through complex presentations. Clinical pearls highlight the subtleties that separate good clinicians from great ones.

This is where theory becomes skill. This is where you learn to think like a concussion specialist.

45 minutes. Real cases. Practical solutions. Let's begin."

## Module 4: Post-Concussion Syndrome & Long-Term Management (60s)

**[VISUAL: Patient journey timeline, persistent symptoms]**

"Module 4: Post-Concussion Syndrome and Long-Term Management.

Most concussions resolve in 7 to 10 days. But 10 to 30 percent don't. These are your most challenging patients.

Post-concussion syndrome isn't a single entity—it's a constellation of persistent symptoms requiring phenotype-specific treatment. Headache, vestibular, ocular-motor, cervicogenic, mood-cognitive—each demands a different approach.

This module teaches you to differentiate true PCS from concussion mimics. You'll master the diagnostic criteria, the red flags that demand specialist referral, and the evidence-based interventions that actually work.

Interactive infographics map symptom clusters to treatment pathways. Clinical algorithms guide your decision-making. Knowledge checks ensure you can identify high-risk presentations.

When symptoms persist, this is your playbook. Let's dive in."

## Module 5: Multidisciplinary Approach to Concussion Management (60s)

**[VISUAL: Healthcare team collaboration, integrated care model]**

"Module 5: Multidisciplinary Approach to Concussion Management.

Concussion care isn't a solo sport. The best outcomes happen when physiotherapists, doctors, psychologists, and occupational therapists work as a coordinated team.

This module maps the complete multidisciplinary landscape—who does what, when to refer, and how to communicate across disciplines.

You'll learn the role of neurologists, vestibular therapists, optometrists, and sports psychologists. You'll understand when psychiatric consultation is essential, and when aggressive treatment causes more harm than good.

Interactive team frameworks show you how leading sports medicine clinics structure their concussion programs. Case studies demonstrate seamless handoffs between providers.

Solo practitioners think linearly. Teams think systemically. This module makes you a team player.

Ready? Let's go."

## Module 6: Return to Play, Work, and School Protocols (60s)

**[VISUAL: Athlete progression through graduated return stages]**

"Module 6: Return to Play, Work, and School Protocols.

The question every patient asks: 'When can I get back to normal?'

Your answer determines whether they recover fully or develop persistent symptoms. Return-to-activity protocols aren't suggestions—they're evidence-based frameworks that reduce re-injury risk and optimize outcomes.

This module teaches the Australian-standard graduated return-to-sport protocol, return-to-learn strategies for students, and workplace accommodation guidelines for adults.

You'll master progression criteria, recognize when patients are pushing too hard, and learn the red flags that demand pulling back.

Interactive decision trees guide progression decisions. Clinical scenarios test your judgment. Flowcharts provide clear documentation frameworks for medicolegal protection.

Return-to-activity is an art informed by science. This module teaches both. Let's begin."

## Module 7: Rehabilitation Pathways by Phenotype (60s)

**[VISUAL: Symptom clusters branching into treatment pathways]**

"Module 7: Rehabilitation Pathways by Phenotype.

Not all concussions are created equal. Different symptom profiles require completely different rehabilitation approaches.

The vestibular patient needs balance training and habituation exercises. The cervicogenic patient needs manual therapy and motor control retraining. The ocular-motor patient needs vision therapy and convergence exercises.

This module organizes concussion rehabilitation into six clinical phenotypes—each with specific assessment tools, treatment protocols, and progression criteria.

You'll learn to identify which phenotype dominates your patient's presentation, how to target treatment precisely, and when phenotypes overlap requiring hybrid approaches.

Interactive treatment algorithms map symptoms to interventions. Clinical pearls highlight the nuances that predict treatment success.

Generic rehabilitation fails. Phenotype-specific treatment succeeds. This is your roadmap. Let's get started."

## Module 8: Legal, Ethical, Communication & Documentation (60s)

**[VISUAL: Medical documentation, legal scales, communication icons]**

"Module 8: Legal, Ethical, Communication, and Documentation.

Concussion management isn't just clinical—it's medicolegal. Poor documentation ends careers. Inadequate communication creates liability. Ethical missteps destroy trust.

This module teaches the legal framework governing concussion care in Australia—duty of care, informed consent, return-to-play clearance, and medicolegal documentation standards.

You'll learn how to communicate with worried parents, negotiate with coaches pressuring athletes to return, and document decisions that protect you legally.

Interactive scenarios test your ethical reasoning. Documentation templates provide AHPRA-compliant frameworks. Communication scripts help you navigate difficult conversations.

The best clinicians aren't just technically skilled—they're legally protected and ethically grounded.

This is your final module. This is where clinical excellence meets professional practice. Let's finish strong."
