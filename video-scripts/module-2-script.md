**NARRATOR:**
"Welcome to Module 2: Concussion Diagnosis and Initial Assessment. This is where theory meets clinical practice.

Over the next 15 minutes, we'll master the essential diagnostic tools you'll use daily—SCAT6, VOMS, BESS, cranial nerve screening, and cervical evaluation. By the end, you'll have a systematic approach to assess any suspected concussion across all age groups.

This module is worth 5 AHPRA CPD points. Let's begin."

## SECTION 1: ACUTE ON-FIELD ASSESSMENT PROTOCOL (0:45 - 3:00)

[VISUAL: Sideline assessment scene, red flag checklist]

**NARRATOR:**
"Picture this: You're pitchside. An athlete takes a hard hit. What's your first move?

The primary assessment framework follows a life-saving first approach: ABCs—Airway, Breathing, Circulation—before any concussion-specific testing. Never compromise immediate life threats for concussion assessment.

Now, once the athlete is conscious and stable, you're screening for red flags. These require immediate emergency referral:

- Loss of consciousness greater than one minute
- Seizures
- Worsening headache or repeated vomiting
- Limb weakness or numbness
- Unequal or fixed pupils
- Midline cervical tenderness

If any of these are present, call emergency services. No exceptions.

If the athlete is stable and red flags are absent, rapid neurological and cognitive screening begins. This is where the Glasgow Coma Scale and Maddocks Questions come in."

**NARRATOR:**
"The Glasgow Coma Scale assesses consciousness level across three domains, with scores ranging from 3 to 15:

Eye Opening: Spontaneous gets 4 points, to speech gets 3, to pain gets 2, none gets 1.

Verbal Response: Oriented gets 5, confused gets 4, inappropriate words get 3, incomprehensible sounds get 2, none gets 1.

Motor Response: Obeys commands gets 6 points, localizes pain gets 5, withdraws from pain gets 4, abnormal flexion gets 3, extension gets 2, and no response gets 1.

For concussion, you're typically seeing scores of 13 to 15—that's mild TBI. Scores of 12 or below require immediate medical referral."

## SECTION 2: SCAT6 TOOL FAMILY (3:00 - 5:30)

[VISUAL: SCAT6 family of tools displayed]

**NARRATOR:**
"Let's talk about SCAT6—the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool, version 6. This is your gold standard for comprehensive concussion assessment.

There are three tools in the SCAT6 family:

First, SCAT6 itself—for adolescents and adults. Used in sideline, clinical, and emergency department settings. This is your comprehensive tool with full symptom inventory, cognitive testing, and balance assessment.

Second, SCOAT6—the Office Assessment Tool. This is a streamlined version for time-limited clinical settings, focusing on core symptom evaluation and rapid cognitive screening.

Third, Child SCAT6—for ages 5 to 12. This uses age-appropriate language, simplified cognitive tasks, and incorporates caregiver input. Because kids can't always articulate their symptoms accurately.

Now, critical point: All SCAT tools should be interpreted in context. Baseline scores—if you have them—are invaluable. But the scores guide clinical decisions; they don't define concussion severity on their own.

SCAT6 has four clinical application phases:

Phase 1: Immediate on-field assessment. Red flags, observable signs, Maddocks questions. This determines if removal from play is required.

Phase 2: Post-injury assessment, 0 to 72 hours. Full SCAT6 evaluation including symptom severity, cognitive tests with the Standardized Assessment of Concussion, and balance assessment with BESS.

Phase 3: Serial monitoring over the first few days. You're tracking symptom improvement or worsening to guide graduated return-to-play.

Phase 4: Return-to-play decision. Combined assessment with clinical judgment to determine when safe resumption is appropriate. Persistent symptoms mean specialist referral."

## SECTION 3: COGNITIVE & BALANCE TESTING (5:30 - 7:30)

[VISUAL: SAC testing, BESS demonstration]

**NARRATOR:**
"The cognitive component uses the Standardized Assessment of Concussion—or SAC. You're testing four domains:

Orientation: person, place, time. What's your name? Where are we? What month is it?

Immediate memory: word list recall. You give them five words, they repeat them back, three trials.

Concentration: digit sequences backwards, months of the year backwards.

And delayed recall: those five words again after five minutes.

Now let's talk balance. BESS—the Balance Error Scoring System—tests postural stability in three stances: double-leg, single-leg, and tandem. Each stance is performed on two surfaces: firm ground and foam pad. Eyes closed for 20 seconds each.

Why eyes closed? Because you're removing visual input, forcing reliance on vestibular and somatosensory systems.

Why foam? Because it disrupts proprioceptive feedback, engaging the vestibular system more heavily.

You're counting errors: hands lifting off hips, opening eyes, stepping, moving feet, lifting the heel, hip abduction beyond 30 degrees. The tandem stance on foam is the killer—it's the most sensitive condition for detecting balance deficits.

Increased errors indicate balance impairment. The cerebellum integrates proprioceptive, vestibular, and visual inputs. Dysfunction anywhere in this system leads to coordination errors."

## SECTION 4: CRANIAL NERVE SCREENING (7:30 - 10:00)

[VISUAL: Cranial nerve anatomy, clinical testing demonstrations]

**NARRATOR:**
"Here's a stat that should change your clinical practice: 12.6% of head-injured patients have cranial nerve injuries. That's more than 1 in 10. In mild TBI specifically, the olfactory nerve—Cranial Nerve I—is most frequently injured, followed by the facial, oculomotor, and trochlear nerves.

You need a rapid verbal screen: 'Any changes in smell, vision, hearing, or taste?' That's testing Cranial Nerves 1, 2, 7, 8, and 9. 'Problems chewing, swallowing, or speaking?' That's Cranial Nerves 5, 10, and 12. 'Balance or shoulder and neck movement issues?' That's Cranial Nerves 8 and 11.

Now, let me give you the high-yield tests:

Cranial Nerve II—the Optic nerve. Test visual acuity with a Snellen chart, visual fields with confrontation testing, and pupillary light reflex. Abnormalities suggest optic neuropathy or increased intracranial pressure.

Cranial Nerve III—Oculomotor. Assess H-pattern eye movements, pupil response, and accommodation. Ptosis, dilated pupil, or impaired eye movement indicates CN III damage.

Cranial Nerve IV—Trochlear. Test inferomedial tracking for downward-inward gaze. Vertical diplopia when looking down suggests CN IV dysfunction, very common after head trauma.

Cranial Nerve VI—Abducens. Test lateral gaze. Inability to abduct the eye or horizontal diplopia indicates CN VI palsy.

Cranial Nerve VII—Facial. Ask the patient to raise eyebrows, close eyes tightly, smile, puff cheeks. Facial asymmetry or weakness suggests facial nerve injury.

And Cranial Nerve VIII—Vestibulocochlear. Perform Rinne and Weber tuning fork tests for hearing. Assess balance and dizziness. This nerve is critical for vestibular function."

## SECTION 5: VOMS TESTING (10:00 - 12:00)

[VISUAL: VOMS test demonstrations]

**NARRATOR:**
"VOMS—the Vestibulo-Ocular Motor Screening—is one of your most valuable tools for subacute assessment. It's most effective more than 72 hours post-injury when you're evaluating persistent symptoms.

VOMS assesses vestibular and oculomotor function through five tests:

Smooth Pursuit: The patient tracks a slow-moving target horizontally and vertically for 30 seconds. Jerky movements or symptom increase suggests parieto-occipital or cerebellar dysfunction.

Saccades: The patient rapidly shifts gaze between two targets, 10 repetitions. Delayed or inaccurate movements indicate frontal lobe or superior colliculus impairment.

Convergence: The target approaches the patient's nose slowly until they see double or experience symptoms. Early diplopia or eye drift indicates cranial nerve three or brainstem coordination issues.

VOR—Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex: Head rotates side-to-side while the patient fixates on a target for 30 seconds. Visual blur or dizziness indicates vestibular-ocular integration dysfunction.

And VMS—Visual Motion Sensitivity: The patient is exposed to a moving visual stimulus for 30 seconds. Motion-induced symptoms suggest cortical or vestibular processing issues.

For each test, you're rating symptoms on a 0 to 10 scale before and after. A 2-point or greater increase in headache, nausea, dizziness, visual blur, light sensitivity, or motion sensitivity indicates an abnormal response.

This is critical: VOMS identifies the specific dysfunction driving persistent symptoms, allowing you to tailor rehabilitation."

## SECTION 6: CERVICAL SPINE ASSESSMENT (12:00 - 14:00)

[VISUAL: Cervical assessment techniques]

**NARRATOR:**
"Here's something many clinicians miss: concussion often involves concomitant cervical spine dysfunction. Cervicogenic headaches, whiplash-associated disorders, proprioceptive impairments—these can mimic or compound concussion symptoms.

First, red flags requiring immediate referral: cervical fractures or instability, significant midline tenderness, neurological deficits like weakness or sensory loss, severe range-of-motion limitations, or vertebral artery dissection signs.

Your clinical examination includes active and passive range of motion in all directions, Spurling's Test for cervical radiculopathy, and palpation for tenderness or muscle spasm.

Now, specific differentiation tests:

The Cervical Flexion-Rotation Test assesses C1-C2 mobility and proprioception. Reduced rotation—less than 32 degrees—with headache or dizziness suggests cervicogenic origin.

The Joint Position Error Test: eyes closed, head rotated passively, then the patient actively returns to neutral. Overshoot or inaccuracy indicates cervical proprioceptive dysfunction.

The Smooth-Pursuit Neck Torsion Test: trunk rotated 45 degrees while the head remains neutral during eye tracking. Jerky pursuit only in torsion suggests cervical afferent dysfunction.

And the Head-Neck Differentiation Test: compare symptoms during trunk rotation with head fixed versus head rotation with body fixed. Symptoms with trunk rotation only indicate cervical cause. Symptoms with head rotation only suggest vestibular cause.

Finally, Upper Cervical Syndrome—dysfunction in the atlantoaxial joint, C1-C2. Clinical presentation includes vertigo, cervicogenic headache at the base of the skull, neck pain and stiffness, visual disturbances, tinnitus, and autonomic symptoms triggered by head movements. This mimics concussion perfectly, and you must rule it out."

## CLOSING (14:00 - 15:00)

[VISUAL: Assessment algorithm flowchart]

**NARRATOR:**
"Let's bring it all together. Your systematic approach to concussion assessment:

One: Life-saving first—ABCs and red flag screening.

Two: Glasgow Coma Scale and Maddocks Questions for rapid neurological and cognitive screening.

Three: Comprehensive SCAT6 evaluation including symptom inventory, cognitive testing with SAC, and balance assessment with BESS.

Four: Cranial nerve screening for high-yield deficits—especially oculomotor function.

Five: VOMS testing for subacute vestibular-ocular dysfunction.

And six: Cervical spine assessment to differentiate cervicogenic from vestibular symptoms.

This systematic approach ensures you don't miss critical findings and allows you to tailor treatment to the specific dysfunctions present.

In Module 3, we'll put this into practice with case-based scenarios and acute concussion management protocols.

Complete the knowledge check now—you'll need 2 out of 7 correct to progress and earn your CPD points.

Thank you for watching."
