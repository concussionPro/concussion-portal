**NARRATOR:**
"Welcome to Module 1 of the Concussion Clinical Mastery course. I'm [Your Name], and over the next 15 minutes, we'll explore the fundamental science behind concussion injuries—from the biomechanical forces that cause them, to the complex neurometabolic cascade that occurs at the cellular level.

This module forms the foundation for your clinical practice and is accredited for 5 AHPRA CPD points. By the end, you'll understand not just what a concussion is, but why it behaves the way it does in your patients."

## SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION TO CONCUSSION (1:00 - 3:30)

**NARRATOR:**
"Let's start with the basics. A concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury—or TBI—caused by a direct or indirect force to the head that results in temporary disturbance of brain function.

Now, here's what makes concussions unique: unlike more severe TBIs, concussions typically don't show structural damage on standard neuroimaging like CT or MRI. This is why we call them 'functional' injuries rather than structural ones.

You'll often hear concussions referred to as 'mild traumatic brain injuries.' But I want to challenge that terminology. While it's technically accurate from a classification standpoint, the term 'mild' can be deeply misleading. For many of your patients, the effects can be significant and long-lasting.

Let's look at the numbers. The true incidence of concussion is difficult to determine due to underreporting, but estimates suggest 1.6 to 3.8 million sports-related concussions occur annually in the United States alone. In Australia, similar patterns emerge across rugby, AFL, soccer, and other contact sports. And remember—these are just the reported cases."

## SECTION 2: BIOMECHANICS OF CONCUSSION (3:30 - 6:30)

**NARRATOR:**
"Now, let's get into the mechanics. How does a concussion actually happen?

Concussions occur when rotational or linear acceleration-deceleration forces are transmitted to the brain. Think of it this way: your brain is suspended in cerebrospinal fluid inside your skull. Under normal circumstances, this provides excellent cushioning. But when rapid forces are applied, the brain can move independently from the skull.

These forces cause the brain to move within the skull, potentially resulting in shearing of axons and disruption of neuronal membranes. You'll see two types of injury patterns:

First, 'coup' injuries—that's at the site of impact where the brain contacts the skull.

Second, 'contrecoup' injuries—these occur opposite the site of impact, as the brain rebounds within the skull.

But here's the critical part for your clinical practice: rotational forces are particularly damaging. Why? Because they create shearing stresses throughout the brain tissue. These rotational forces can be generated not just by direct impacts, but also by rapid changes in head velocity without any direct contact.

This is why you'll see concussions from whiplash-type mechanisms, or from forces applied to the body that cause rapid head rotation. It's not always about 'getting hit in the head.'"

## SECTION 3: THE NEUROMETABOLIC CASCADE (6:30 - 10:00)

**NARRATOR:**
"Now we're going to dive deeper—to the cellular level. Because understanding the neurometabolic cascade is absolutely fundamental to managing your patients effectively.

When that mechanical force hits, here's what happens in the first milliseconds:

The initial mechanical disruption leads to ionic flux across neuronal membranes. Specifically, you get massive potassium efflux out of the cells, and calcium influx into the cells. This ionic chaos triggers the neuron's emergency response.

To restore this ionic balance—to get back to homeostasis—the brain dramatically increases glucose metabolism. The neurons are working overtime, burning through energy at an accelerated rate.

But—and this is the cruel irony—simultaneously, there's decreased cerebral blood flow. So you have increased energy demand, but decreased energy supply. This is what we call the 'energy crisis' of concussion.

This mismatch is why rest is so critical in the acute phase. When your patient ignores symptoms and continues high cognitive or physical demands, they're forcing an already energy-depleted brain to work harder.

Now, here's some good news: In most cases, this neurometabolic cascade typically resolves within 7 to 10 days. But—and this is critical for your clinical decision-making—individual variation is significant. Some patients resolve in days; others take weeks or months.

During this vulnerable period, the brain is more susceptible to repeat injury. This is the scientific basis for return-to-play protocols.

There's one more piece: neurotransmitter dysfunction. Particularly involving glutamate and dopamine systems. This contributes to many of the symptoms you'll see clinically—cognitive difficulties, mood changes, irritability, sleep disturbances. These aren't psychological responses to injury; they're neurochemical realities."

## SECTION 4: CLASSIFICATION AND SEVERITY (10:00 - 12:00)

[VISUAL: Old grading systems crossed out, modern assessment approach]

**NARRATOR:**
"Let's talk about how we classify concussions—or more accurately, how we no longer classify them.

You may have learned historical grading systems: Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3—typically based on loss of consciousness and duration. Here's the truth: these are no longer recommended. Current best practice emphasizes individualized assessment rather than categorical grading.

Why the change? Because the presence or absence of loss of consciousness is not a reliable indicator of injury severity or prognosis. You will see severe concussions that occur without any loss of consciousness, and you'll see brief LOC with rapid, complete recovery.

Modern assessment focuses on symptom burden, cognitive function, balance, and other objective measures—rather than attempting to classify severity at the time of injury. We assess the whole clinical picture, and we track it over time.

This is a paradigm shift in how we approach concussion, and it's reflected in the latest SCAT6 and international consensus guidelines."

## SECTION 5: RISK FACTORS (12:00 - 14:00)

**NARRATOR:**
"Finally, let's discuss risk factors—because some patients are more vulnerable than others.

The number one predictor of future concussion is previous concussion history, particularly if insufficient recovery time was allowed. This isn't just about cumulative damage; it may reflect underlying vulnerability, whether genetic, anatomical, or related to incomplete recovery.

Age and developmental stage matter significantly. Adolescents may take longer to recover than adults. Why? Their brains are still developing. Older adults face different challenges—increased complications, longer recovery times, and higher risk of complicating factors like subdural hematomas.

Biological sex appears to influence concussion rates and recovery. Females report higher symptom burdens in some studies. Now, reporting bias may contribute, but there may also be biomechanical factors—neck strength, head-neck mass ratios—and hormonal influences that we're still researching.

Finally, genetics. The APOE ε4 allele has been associated with poorer outcomes after TBI, including concussion. We're not at the point of routine genetic screening, but understanding that genetic factors influence recovery helps explain why identical injuries can have vastly different recovery trajectories."

## CLOSING (14:00 - 15:00)

[VISUAL: Key points recap]

**NARRATOR:**
"Let's recap what we've covered:

Concussion is a functional brain injury caused by rotational and linear forces that trigger a neurometabolic cascade. This cascade typically resolves in 7 to 10 days but varies by individual. Modern assessment focuses on individualized evaluation rather than categorical grading. And certain patients—those with prior concussions, adolescents, and those with genetic risk factors—require extra clinical vigilance.

This foundational knowledge underpins everything we'll cover in subsequent modules—from diagnosis and assessment tools, to rehabilitation protocols, to return-to-play decisions.

Before moving to Module 2, complete the knowledge check to test your understanding. You'll need to score at least 2 out of 3 to progress and earn your CPD points.

Thank you for watching, and I'll see you in Module 2 where we dive into diagnostic criteria and assessment tools."
