**NARRATOR:**
"Welcome to Module 1: What is a Concussion?

A concussion isn't just a bump on the head—it's a complex neurometabolic crisis happening at the cellular level. When rotational forces cause the brain to move within the skull, a cascade of ionic flux and energy depletion begins.

Over the next 45 minutes, you'll explore the biomechanics, the pathophysiology, and the risk factors that determine why identical impacts can have vastly different outcomes.

This isn't textbook theory. This is the foundation of every clinical decision you'll make—from your initial assessment to return-to-play clearance.

You'll master the science through interactive infographics, clinical flowcharts, and knowledge checks embedded throughout the module. No boring lectures. Just the evidence you need to practice confidently.

Ready? Let's dive in."
