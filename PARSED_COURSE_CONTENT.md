### Learning Objectives
- Describe mechanisms of injury and classify diagnostic categories of TBI
- Understand anatomical, biochemical and neurophysiological impact of TBI
- Differentiate severity and use investigative tools
- Understand current imaging use cases and value

### Mechanism of Injury

#### 1. Linear Acceleration (Coup-Contrecoup Injuries)
- Head rapidly moved in straight line (back-and-forth or side-to-side)
- Brain shifts within skull
- **Affected regions:** Frontal lobe, occipital lobe, brainstem
- **Symptoms:** Headache, blurred vision, disorientation, LOC, visual disturbances

#### 2. Rotational (Angular) Acceleration
- Forces cause brain to rotate/twist within skull
- Leads to shearing forces on brain tissue
- **Affected regions:** Corpus callosum, midbrain, cerebellum, frontal and temporal lobes

### Post-Concussion Syndrome (PCS) Definition

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- Symptoms persist ≥3 months post-concussion
- Presence of ≥3 symptoms across cognitive, physical, and emotional clusters
- Other medical/psychological conditions ruled out

### Pathophysiology of PCS

#### Neurochemical Imbalance
- Disruption in neurotransmitters: glutamate, serotonin, dopamine
- Results in: cognitive dysfunction, mood disturbances, headaches

#### Cerebral Metabolism
- Metabolic disruptions in glucose metabolism
- Increased energy demand not met due to compromised blood flow
- Contributes to: fatigue, difficulty concentrating, headache

#### Neuroinflammation
- Activated microglia, pro-inflammatory cytokines release
- Persists long after initial injury
- Contributes to: cognitive dysfunction, mood disturbances, headache

#### Axonal Injury and White Matter Changes
- Axonal injury, white matter integrity disruption
- DTI studies reveal changes in white matter
- Linked to: persistent cognitive deficits, motor symptoms

#### Psychological and Emotional Factors
- Anxiety and depression common
- Exacerbate physical symptoms
- Can be mistaken for or contribute to PCS symptoms

### PCS Symptom Domains

#### Cognitive Symptoms
- Difficulty concentrating/focusing
- Memory impairment (particularly short-term)
- Mental fog/difficulty processing information
- Slowed reaction time

#### Physical Symptoms
- Headaches (tension-type or migraine-like)
- Dizziness and balance problems (vertigo)
- Sensitivity to light and sound
- Fatigue and sleep disturbances

#### Emotional and Behavioral Symptoms
- Irritability
- Anxiety and depression
- Mood swings
- Social withdrawal

### Long-Term Management of PCS

#### 1. Non-Pharmacological Interventions

#### 4. Supplement/Dietary Support

| Nutraceutical | Mechanism of Action | Role in Concussion Recovery |
|---------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Omega-3 (DHA/EPA) | Anti-inflammatory, membrane fluidity | Reduces neuroinflammation, neuronal death |
| Creatine | ATP production, mitochondrial support | Improves brain energy metabolism |
| Magnesium | NMDA modulation, reduces excitotoxicity | Stabilizes neurons, ionic balance |
| Vitamin D | Regulates inflammation, oxidative stress | Shortens recovery time, neuroprotection |
| Curcumin | Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory | Reduces oxidative damage |
| Resveratrol | Mitochondrial function, antioxidant | Supports cerebrovascular function, reduces ROS |

**Management Focus:**
- Cerebral blood flow
- Sleep
- Nutrition/supplementation
- As-tolerated, sub-threshold exercise
- Progressive cognitive load

### Progression from PCS to CTE

#### Anatomical Considerations

**PCS:**
- Cortical involvement: frontal and temporal lobes
- White matter disruptions: DAI in corpus callosum, internal capsule, brainstem
- Vascular disruption: BBB dysfunction

**CTE:**
- Progressive atrophy: medial temporal lobes, hippocampus, amygdala, cerebral cortex
- Tauopathy localization: Starts in sulci depths (frontal/temporal), spreads to diencephalon, brainstem, cerebellum
- Ventricular enlargement: Brain atrophy → lateral and third ventricle dilation

#### Physiological Considerations

**PCS Pathophysiology:**
- Cerebral energy crisis: Hyperacute neuronal depolarization
- BBB dysfunction: Immune cell infiltration, microglial activation
- Autonomic dysfunction: Impaired vagus nerve, brainstem autonomic centers

**CTE Pathophysiology:**
- Tau hyperphosphorylation: Neurofibrillary tangles, disrupted microtubule integrity
- Chronic neuroinflammation: Persistent microglia/astrocyte activation
- Amyloid deposition: Not always present (unlike Alzheimer's)

#### Biochemical Considerations

**PCS Biochemistry:**
- Mitochondrial dysfunction: Impaired ATP production
- Oxidative stress: Elevated ROS → lipid peroxidation, DNA damage
- Neurotransmitter imbalance: Glutamate excitotoxicity, serotonin dysregulation

**CTE Biochemistry:**
- Pathological tau accumulation: Hyperphosphorylated tau → synaptic failure
- Persistent oxidative stress: Chronic oxidative damage
- Cholinergic deficiency: Reduced acetylcholine → cognitive decline

### Key Factors Driving PCS to CTE Transition

1. **Repeated Head Trauma:** Most significant risk factor
2. **Chronic Neuroinflammation:** Prolonged microglial activation, cytokine production
3. **Failure of Neuronal Repair:** Inadequate resolution of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction

### Indications of CTE Progression

#### 1. Worsening Cognitive Symptoms
- Memory impairment (short-term and long-term)
- Cognitive decline (problem-solving, executive functions)
- Attention issues (difficulty focusing, multitasking)

#### 2. Behavioral and Emotional Changes
- Mood swings (irritability, depression, rapid shifts)
- Aggression and impulsivity
- Apathy (loss of interest, social withdrawal, emotional numbness)
- Depression and anxiety (persistent, severe)
- Suicidal thoughts or behaviors

#### 3. Motor Symptoms
- Parkinsonism (tremors, stiffness, difficulty walking, slowness)
- Balance and coordination issues
- Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing)

#### 4. Progressive Brain Dysfunction
- Confusion and disorientation
- Severe cognitive impairment (dementia-like symptoms)

#### 5. Increased Sensitivity to Stress or Stimuli
- Heightened sensitivity to noise, light, stress
- Emotional overreaction, panic attacks

#### 6. Social and Occupational Decline
- Loss of occupational functioning
- Relationship strain

- Vestibular/Ocular Motor Screening (VOMS)

### Multidisciplinary Referral Flow Example

```
Initial GP assessment → suspect concussion
  ↓
→ Refer to Physio for balance/vestibular rehab
→ Refer to Psychologist for mood/sleep disturbance
→ Notify School Liaison for academic supports
→ Neurology referral if symptoms >4 weeks or red flags
```

Ensure communication between all professionals through shared notes or case coordinator.

### Cultural Safety in Concussion Management

**Core Principles:**
- Acknowledge historical trauma (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples)
- Engage in shared decision-making with patients and families
- Be aware of culturally-specific expressions of distress (silence, withdrawal)
- Use interpreters where language barriers exist

**Practical Implementation:**
- Use culturally appropriate language (avoid clinical jargon)
- Engage Aboriginal health workers/liaison officers
- Utilize interpreters when needed
- Recognize non-verbal expressions of distress/discomfort

### Role Play Activity: "Referral, Reality, and Responsibility"

**Scenario:**
- 32-year-old female schoolteacher, 10 days post-MVA, confirmed concussion
- Symptoms: Intermittent headaches, visual tracking issues, anxiety about classroom return, light sensitivity, mental fatigue after ~30 min screen use, poor sleep, emotional fragility
- Self-referred, full-time work, limited private health, can only afford 1-2 clinicians over next month

**Task (8 minutes):**
1. **Triage symptoms:** Working hypothesis for ongoing symptoms?
2. **Prioritize care:** Given constraints, who should she see first? Expected outcome?
3. **Plan staged referrals:** If improves, who's next? If not, how communicate?
4. **Draft interprofessional email (2 sentences max):**
   - Clinical concern
   - Why referral important now
   - What you need from them

**Group Debrief (4-6 minutes):**
- What was hardest to decide?
- Did anyone feel their profession was under-prioritized? Why?
- How can clinicians better collaborate when not sharing practice?
- How explain referral urgency/value to hesitant/overwhelmed patient?

### Upper Cervical and Suboccipital Management

**Evidence for Manual Therapy:**

**Reneker et al. (2021):**
- 38 PCS patients
- Protocol: Early cervical manual therapy + canalith repositioning (Epley) + integrated vision/vestibular therapy
- Results: Significant improvements in clinical assessments and patient-reported outcomes

**De Iovanna et al. (2021):**
- Cervicogenic headaches (often associated with concussion)
- Effective techniques: Spinal manipulative therapy, Mulligan's SNAGs, cervical muscle techniques
- Reduced headache intensity and frequency

**Marshall et al. (2015):**
- PCS cases with active rehabilitation + passive manual therapy of cervical spine
- Resulted in significant symptom reduction

**Dry Needling:**
- Clinical benefits in reducing cervicogenic headaches, dizziness, reduced cervical mobility
- Targets myofascial trigger points in suboccipital region
- Decreases symptom severity, improves ROM, restores sensorimotor control

### At-Home Management: MOVE Protocol

**Montreal Virtual Exertion (MOVE) Protocol:**
- Graded exertion test for concussion recovery
- Administered virtually (remote monitoring)

**Structure:**
- 7 stages
- Bodyweight and plyometric exercises
- 60 seconds per stage
- Incrementally increases cardiovascular demand

**Implementation:**
- Evaluated with 20 healthy children (via Zoom)
- 30 children with subacute concussion (MOVE vs BCTT)
- Results: No adverse events, met all feasibility criteria, comparable HR and perceived exertion

**Clinical Implications:**
- Virtual compatibility for remote assessment
- Structured, stepwise approach

## MODULE 6: RETURN TO PLAY / RETURN TO WORK PROTOCOLS

### Learning Objectives
- Apply stage-based protocols for return to physical activity and work
- Design safe, progressive plans for sport, school, and work reintegration
- Evaluate readiness using subjective and objective clinical findings
- Incorporate physical exertion testing in RTP decisions
- Ensure protocols align with current consensus guidelines (Amsterdam 2022)

### Graduated Return-to-Play (RTP) Protocol

#### Phase 1: Acute Recovery and Initial Rest (24-48 Hours)

**Pathophysiology:**
- Brain undergoes metabolic dysfunction, ionic shifts, reduced cerebral blood flow
- Period of neurometabolic vulnerability
- Excessive activity may exacerbate symptoms and delay recovery

**Clinical Recommendations:**
- **Cognitive & Physical Rest:**
  - Avoid sustained attention, screen exposure, physical exertion
  - Light activities (brief walks) permitted if no symptom provocation
- **Sleep Hygiene:** Adequate sleep duration and quality for neurorecovery
- **Medication & Nutritional Support:**
  - Avoid NSAIDs, sedatives (may mask symptoms, bleeding risks)
  - Consider omega-3 supplementation, high-protein diet

**Progression Criteria:**
- Symptom-free or only mild, non-disruptive symptoms at rest

#### Phase 2: Symptom-Limited Activity

**Purpose:**
- Introduce gradual cognitive and physical engagement without exacerbating symptoms
- Restore cerebral autoregulation and autonomic function

**Permitted Activities:**
- Light household chores
- Reading, screen time (limited to 30 min per session)
- Slow-paced walking (≤15 min)
- Academic accommodations (extra time, reduced workload)

**Progression Criteria:**
- No symptom exacerbation during or after light activities

#### Phase 3: Light Aerobic Exercise

**Purpose:**
- Restore cardiovascular conditioning
- Avoid vestibular strain or head impacts
- Assess for exercise-induced symptom recurrence

**Permitted Activities:**
- Treadmill walking (up to 60% max HR)
- Stationary cycling (low resistance)

**Monitoring Parameters:**
- **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** Abnormal = autonomic dysregulation
- **Neurocognitive Testing:** Processing speed, reaction time, memory recall (ImPACT, SCAT6)

**Progression Criteria:**
- No headache, dizziness, nausea during/after exercise
- Stable HRV and neurocognitive scores vs baseline

#### Phase 4: Sport-Specific Exercise (Non-Contact)

**Purpose:**
- Reintroduce movement patterns and neuromuscular control
- Assess vestibular-ocular function in dynamic environments

**Permitted Activities:**
- Dribbling, running drills, agility work (NO contact/high-impact)
- Vestibular therapy if needed (gaze stabilization, balance exercises)

**Key Assessments:**
- **King-Devick Test:** Saccadic eye movements, reaction time
- **Dual-task performance:** Cognitive + motor integration

**Progression Criteria:**
- Full participation without vertigo, blurred vision, disorientation

#### Phase 5: Full-Contact Practice

**Purpose:**
- Assess tolerance to high-intensity play, decision-making, cognitive workload
- Ensure readiness for competitive sport conditions

**Permitted Activities:**
- Full practice drills, controlled scrimmages
- Weightlifting with progressive resistance

**Neurological Clearance Criteria:**
- Normal VOR function
- No cognitive fatigue or slowed reaction time
- Symptom-free at rest AND after exertion

**Medical Clearance Required:**
- Licensed medical professional (neurologist, sports medicine physician)
- Evaluate symptom resolution, neurocognitive performance, physiological markers

#### Phase 6: Return to Competition

**Final Considerations:**
- Continued symptom monitoring post-return
- Education on concussion risk and preventative measures
- Assessment for psychological readiness (fear of re-injury, confidence)

### Key Takeaways for Medical Professionals
- RTP progression is individualized—not all athletes recover at same rate
- Neurocognitive & vestibular testing essential for informed decision-making
- Persistent symptoms beyond 4 weeks require multidisciplinary approach
- Long-term monitoring crucial for athletes with multiple concussions or PCS

### Return-to-School (RTS) Protocol

**Goal:** Gradually reintegrate students into academic environment while managing cognitive strain

#### Stepwise RTS Approach

**Phase 1: Cognitive Rest (24-48 hours)**
- Avoid reading, screen use, homework
- Short, quiet activities allowed (listening to music)

**Phase 2: Light Cognitive Activity**
- 10-15 min bursts of reading or screen use
- No homework, quizzes, extended classwork
- If symptoms worsen, rest and retry later

**Phase 3: Partial School Return**
- Half-day attendance or reduced workload
- Extended test-taking time or verbal exams
- Avoid sports or PE classes

**Phase 4: Full Academic Load, No PE/Sports**
- Full school days with accommodations
- Monitor for cognitive fatigue, headaches
- PE exemption

**Phase 5: Full Academic + Physical Participation**
- Return to normal workload AND PE/sports if cleared

**Progression Criteria:**
- No symptoms after full academic day
- Normal cognitive endurance

**Key Considerations:**
- Students often require more accommodations than athletes
- Cognitive strain can be as exhausting as physical activity

### Return-to-Work (RTW) Protocol

**Goal:** Restore occupational functioning without exacerbating symptoms

#### Stepwise RTW Approach

**Phase 1: Initial Rest (24-48 Hours)**
- Complete work absence
- No emails, reports, decision-making

**Phase 2: Limited Screen/Workload**
- ≤2 hours/day of light duties
- No multitasking or prolonged meetings
- Allow frequent rest breaks

**Phase 3: Half-Day Work Schedule**
- ≤4 hours/day, flexible tasks
- Avoid complex problem-solving, prolonged screen use

**Phase 4: Near-Full Workload, No Overtime**
- Resume most tasks with limited cognitive stress
- No long meetings, fast-paced work, night shifts

**Phase 5: Full Workload**
- Resumption of all duties including high-demand tasks

**Progression Criteria:**
- Tolerance toward full work schedule with no symptom recurrence

**Key Considerations:**
- High screen exposure (computer jobs) may slow recovery
- Shift workers, high-pressure jobs require extra precautions
- Employers should offer temporary accommodations

### Return-to-Activity Comparison

| Aspect | RTW | RTS | RTP |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|
| Primary Focus | Cognitive + Occupational Function | Academic Cognitive Load | Physical + Neurological Readiness |
| Main Challenges | Screen time, workload, multitasking | Reading, concentration, screen use | Balance, reaction time, impact tolerance |
| Physical Demand | Low (desk work) | Low to moderate (books, PE) | High (aerobic, reaction speed, contact) |
| Cognitive Demand | High (decision-making, screen, multitask) | High (lectures, exams, memorization) | Variable (sports strategy, motor planning) |
| Monitoring | Fatigue, headaches, screen tolerance | Attention, memory, headaches | Coordination, balance, reaction speed |
| Modifications | Flexible hours, screen breaks, workload | Shortened days, extra test time, notes | Gradual training, symptom monitoring |

### Recovery Timeline Guide (Typical Cases)

| Age Group | Expected Symptom Duration | Return to Learning/Work | Full Activity Return |
|-----------|--------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Children (6-12 yrs) | 1-2 weeks | Gradual re-entry in 3-5 days | ~2-3 weeks |
| Teens (13-18 yrs) | 2-3 weeks | School plan by day 5-7 | ~3-4 weeks |
| Adults (19-60 yrs) | 1-3 weeks | Light duties in 5-10 days | ~2-4 weeks |
| Older Adults (60+ yrs) | 3+ weeks (often slower) | Functional re-engagement by 1-2 weeks | 4+ weeks, tailored |

### Multiple In-Season Concussions

**Managing Multiple Concussions:**
- Higher risk: prolonged recovery, cumulative impairment, second impact syndrome, CTE
- Extended rest and recovery periods
- Comprehensive baseline and post-injury testing (neurocognitive, vestibular, ocular)
- Multidisciplinary involvement (neurologists, neuropsychologists, vestibular therapists)
- Consider season termination for recurrent injuries with prolonged symptoms

### Prioritizing Return to School Over Return to Play

**Key Principles:**
- Early cognitive rest (24-48 hours) then gradual increase in schoolwork
- Close monitoring of cognitive symptoms
- Communication and collaboration (healthcare, school, parents, athlete)
- Delayed RTP until full cognitive recovery
- Education for families and athletes on importance of cognitive recovery

### Clinical Tools
