**Thinks:**
- "Wait... am I missing subtle signs?"

### 6. DECISION POINT

**Sarah's Internal Dialogue:**

**PROS:**
- ✅ AHPRA accredited (counts for registration)
- ✅ 14 CPD hours (need to maintain anyway)
- ✅ Comprehensive (not just SCAT6, but VOMS, BESS, RTP)
- ✅ Hands-on workshop (can't learn this from YouTube)
- ✅ Already used their form - quality is high
- ✅ 500+ clinicians trained (others trust it)
- ✅ Limited spots (might miss out if I wait)

**CONS:**
- ❌ $1,190 is significant (but $85/CPD hour is actually good)
- ❌ Time commitment (but can do online modules whenever)

**Thinks:**
- "I DO second-guess my concussion assessments..."
- "If I miss something and patient gets worse, that's on me..."
- "My clinic wants me to do CPD anyway..."
- "Other physios are doing this training - I should too..."
- "Workshop spots are limited - if I wait, I might miss Melbourne..."

**Emotion:** 😬 Urgency (fear of missing out + professional responsibility)

## 🎯 Conversion Psychology Breakdown

### Why This Funnel Works

1. **FREE VALUE FIRST**
   - Provides genuine utility (free SCAT forms)
   - Builds trust (professional, works well)
   - Lowers defenses (not immediately selling)

2. **STRATEGIC DOUBT INJECTION**
   - Banner asks: "Confident using this form clinically?"
   - Implies: "You might think you know this, but you probably don't"
   - Lists specific gaps: VOMS interpretation, vestibular red flags, BESS nuances
   - **Creates anxiety that only the course can resolve**

3. **SOCIAL PROOF**
   - "500+ Australian clinicians trained"
   - **If others are doing it, I should too**
   - Creates FOMO: "Am I behind my peers?"

4. **URGENCY**
   - "Limited workshop spots" with 🔥 emoji
   - **Scarcity drives action NOW vs later**
   - Fear: "I might miss out on Melbourne/Sydney workshop"

5. **PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY**
   - "Most clinicians miss subtle signs"
   - **Hits duty of care: "What if I miss something critical?"**
   - Makes NOT training feel irresponsible

6. **AHPRA JUSTIFICATION**
   - 14 CPD hours
   - Need CPD anyway for registration
   - **Makes purchase feel necessary, not optional**

7. **PRICE ANCHORING**
   - $1,190 seems high initially
   - But: $85 per CPD hour is standard
   - Plus: hands-on workshop (can't get elsewhere)
   - **Justifies the investment**

## 🎬 Would Sarah Buy?

### Short Answer: **YES, highly likely**

### Why:

1. **She searched for SCAT6** = actively dealing with concussion case
2. **She experienced value** = forms work great, trust established
3. **Banner planted doubt** = "Am I missing signs?"
4. **Social proof** = 500+ others trained (validation)
5. **Urgency** = limited workshop spots (action trigger)
6. **Professional responsibility** = can't afford to miss signs
7. **AHPRA justification** = needs CPD anyway
8. **Price is defensible** = $85/CPD hour + hands-on workshop

### Estimated Conversion Rate: **12-18%**
(Of users who actually use the SCAT forms, not just visit homepage)

## 🚀 What Makes Someone "Desperate" to Buy

### The Funnel Achieves This By:

1. **Creating Knowledge Gap Awareness**
   - User didn't know they had knowledge gaps
   - Banner explicitly lists what they're missing
   - Suddenly feels incompetent (powerful motivator)

2. **Associating Gap with Risk**
   - "Missing subtle signs" = patient harm
   - Professional liability fear
   - **Not buying feels RISKY, buying feels SAFE**

3. **Providing Immediate Solution**
   - Banner → Preview → Shop (smooth path)
   - Can solve anxiety RIGHT NOW
   - **Buying relieves discomfort**

4. **Making Inaction Feel Worse Than Action**
   - Doing nothing = continuing to miss signs
   - Doing nothing = falling behind 500+ peers
   - Doing nothing = might miss workshop spot
   - **Doing something (buying) feels like the safe choice**

---

### Strengths:
- ✅ Excellent entry hook (free forms)
- ✅ Strategic doubt injection
- ✅ Strong social proof
- ✅ Clear urgency
- ✅ Professional positioning
- ✅ AHPRA justification built-in
