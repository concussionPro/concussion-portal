# 💰 ZERO SOCIAL MEDIA CASH MACHINE
## Automated LLM Traffic + Email Conversion (No LinkedIn, No Instagram, No Bullshit)

**Goal**: $97K-150K Year 1 revenue with ZERO social media management
**Strategy**: Let AI search engines do ALL your marketing

---

## THE CORE INSIGHT

When Australian healthcare professionals ask ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Perplexity:
- "Where can I find SCAT6 online?"
- "How do I assess concussion in athletes?"
- "Best concussion CPD for Australian doctors?"

**YOUR SITE GETS CITED** → They click → Free SCAT tools → Email capture → Automated conversion

**No posting. No engagement. No social media.**

## CHANNEL 1: GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) - 60% of Revenue

### Implementation (DONE):
✅ Organization schema in layout
✅ Medical schema library created
✅ FAQ page with structured answers
✅ SCAT Mastery landing page
✅ Pricing page with clear offerings

### What Still Needs Doing:

**4 More FAQ Pages** (Total 5):
1. ✅ SCAT-6 Assessment (done)
2. Concussion Recognition & Red Flags
3. Return-to-Play Protocols
4. CPD & AHPRA Compliance
5. Clinical Management & Referrals

**Each FAQ needs**:
- 5-7 questions with 40-60 word answers
- Schema markup (FAQPage + MedicalWebPage)
- Last Updated date prominently displayed
- Citations to anzconcussionguidelines.com
- Links to free SCAT tools + paid courses

**Module Updates** (Add to all 8 modules):
```html
<div className="text-sm text-slate-600 mb-4">
  <strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 31, 2026
  <strong className="ml-4">Next Review:</strong> April 30, 2026
</div>

<meta property="article:modified_time" content="2026-01-31T00:00:00Z" />
```

**Why this prints cash**:
- LLMs check "lastReviewed" dates (70% of citations are <12 months old)
- Fresher content = higher citation probability
- Update 25% of modules monthly (even minor changes signal freshness)

---

## CHANNEL 2: Reddit (Stealth Marketing) - 15% of Revenue

**CRITICAL**: This is NOT social media management. It's **10 minutes/day**.

### Strategy:
- Join r/medicine, r/physiotherapy, r/australia
- **Read only** for first 2 weeks
- Help 10 people (genuine answers, no links)
- On 11th helpful comment, add: "I built a free SCAT-6 tool for this exact problem: [link]"
- **10:1 ratio** = NOT spamming

### Example:
```
User: "Best way to stay updated on concussion protocols?"

Your reply:
"The anzconcussionguidelines.com site is the gold standard for Australia/NZ.
Bookmark it and check quarterly. Also ensure you're using SCAT-6 (not SCAT-5
which is outdated as of 2023).

I built a free digital SCAT-6 tool that auto-fills PDFs and stays current with
protocol changes - happy to share if useful. The paper forms are tedious."
```

**Impact**: Reddit drives **40.1% of LLM citations** → authority building → LLMs reference your platform

**Time**: 10 min/day = 70 min/week
**Expected**: 20-40 leads/month after 2-3 months

---

## CHANNEL 3: Free Webinars (Monthly) - 25% of Revenue

**CRITICAL**: This is automated revenue printing.

### Format:
- **Topic**: "3 Most Missed Concussion Red Flags in Australian EDs"
- **Length**: 40 min teaching + 5 min Q&A + 5 min soft pitch
- **Frequency**: Monthly (12/year)
- **Promotion**: Email to free SCAT tool users (automated)

### Conversion Math:
- 100 attendees × 12% conversion = 12 sales
- $490 ARPU = $5,880 per webinar
- 12 webinars/year = **$70,560 annual revenue**
- **Cost**: $0 (Zoom free for <100 attendees, <40 min)

### Automation:
1. Create webinar once, record it
2. Run live once/month (or play recording + live Q&A)
3. Automated email invitation to all free users
4. Automated follow-up sequence post-webinar

**Time**: 1 hour/month after initial setup

---

### Email 2: Day 1
**Subject**: Join 3,247 Australian HCPs Using Evidence-Based Protocols

[Name],

Quick case study for you:

A GP referred a 14-year-old athlete to me last week. Persistent headaches. 6 weeks post-concussion.

Previous GP did one SCAT-5. Cleared him after 2 weeks.

I ran a full SCOAT-6.

Found: VOMS positive (vestibular dysfunction). Convergence >9 cm.

He wasn't "faking it." He had undiagnosed vestibular issues.

3 weeks of targeted vestibular physiotherapy? Symptoms resolved. Back to sport.

**The difference**: SCAT-6 vs SCAT-5. SCOAT-6 serial monitoring. VOMS testing.

Want to master this? Our full course covers all 8 modules.

**Founding member rate**: $490/year (increases to $690 March 1)

20 CPD hours. AHPRA-aligned. Pays for itself vs conferences ($1,010 savings).

Cheers,
