# ConcussionPro: Complete Site Audit Summary
## Maximum Value Perspective - Clinician User Journey

---

## ✅ WHAT I DID: Complete User Journey Analysis

I went through your entire site as a clinician user (Dr. Sarah Thompson, Melbourne physiotherapist managing concussions daily) and analyzed every touchpoint for maximum value delivery.

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED

### 1. Module Count Mismatch ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Site showed "4 modules / 20 CPD points" but you actually have **8 modules / 40 CPD points**

**Files Fixed:**
- `/app/learning/page.tsx` - Changed 4→8, 20→40
- `/components/dashboard/BentoGrid.tsx` - Updated all references (4 places)

**Impact:** Users were getting incorrect progress tracking and CPD calculations. This broke trust.

### 2. Login Link Missing ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Enrolled students couldn't find login on landing page

**Fix:** Added "Login" link to landing page navigation
