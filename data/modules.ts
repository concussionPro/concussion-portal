          'DEFINITION: A concussion is a complex pathophysiological process affecting the brain, induced by biomechanical forces. It is a functional disturbance rather than structural injury, which is why standard CT and MRI scans typically appear normal.',
          'CLASSIFICATION: Concussion is categorized as a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), representing 70-90% of all TBI cases. However, the term "mild" refers to initial presentation, not severity of symptoms or long-term impact.',
          'EPIDEMIOLOGY: Estimated 1.6 to 3.8 million sports-related concussions occur annually in the United States, with actual incidence likely higher due to underreporting. In Australia, approximately 180,000 concussions occur annually across all settings (sports, workplace, motor vehicle accidents, falls).',
          'GLOBAL BURDEN: Concussion affects all age groups, from pediatric athletes to elderly fall victims. The socioeconomic impact includes healthcare costs, lost productivity, and reduced quality of life. Understanding concussion mechanisms is essential for prevention, diagnosis, and management.',

          'The brain, suspended in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), moves independently of the skull during rapid head motion. This differential movement creates shearing forces on neural tissue.',
          'Four primary mechanisms contribute to concussion injury: (1) Rotational/Angular forces, (2) Linear/Translational forces, (3) Coup-Contrecoup injuries, and (4) Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI). Each mechanism has distinct biomechanical properties and clinical implications.',

        title: 'Mechanism 1: Rotational (Angular) Forces',
        content: [
          '🔄 MECHANISM: Rotational acceleration occurs when the head rotates around its center of mass. This creates angular momentum and shearing stresses throughout brain tissue.',
          'BIOMECHANICS: The brain\'s outer cortex and inner structures rotate at different velocities due to varying densities and attachment points. This differential rotation stretches and tears axons, particularly at grey-white matter junctions.',
          'CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Rotational forces are considered the most damaging mechanism in concussion. Even without direct head contact, rapid rotation can cause severe injury (e.g., whiplash-associated concussion).',
          'EXAMPLES: Boxing hook punch, rugby tackle causing head rotation, car accident with lateral impact, rotational fall in elderly.',
          'FORCE THRESHOLD: Research suggests rotational accelerations >4500-6000 rad/s² can produce concussion, though individual thresholds vary significantly.',

          '↔️ MECHANISM: Linear acceleration involves straight-line movement of the entire head in one direction (anterior-posterior, lateral, or superior-inferior).',
          'BIOMECHANICS: The skull accelerates rapidly while the brain lags behind due to inertia, then catches up and may impact the inner skull surface. This creates compression and tension forces.',
          'CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Linear forces alone rarely cause concussion unless extremely high magnitude. Most real-world concussions involve combined linear and rotational forces.',
          'EXAMPLES: Direct frontal impact in motor vehicle accident, fall directly onto back of head, frontal collision in contact sports.',
          'FORCE THRESHOLD: Linear accelerations >60-100g (where g = 9.8 m/s²) may produce concussion, though threshold varies by impact duration and location.',

          '💥 MECHANISM: Coup injury occurs at the site of direct impact. Contrecoup injury occurs on the opposite side of the brain due to rebound forces.',
          'BIOMECHANICS: Upon impact, the skull deforms slightly and compresses underlying brain tissue (coup). The brain then moves away from impact site and may strike the opposite side of the skull (contrecoup). Negative pressure at the coup site and positive pressure at contrecoup site create cavitation and tissue damage.',
          'CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Contrecoup injuries can be more severe than coup injuries due to the brain\'s movement properties and skull anatomy. The frontal and temporal lobes are particularly vulnerable to contrecoup damage when impact occurs to the occiput.',
          'EXAMPLES: Fall backward onto occiput causing frontal lobe contrecoup injury, frontal impact causing occipital contrecoup.',
          'IMAGING CORRELATION: Coup and contrecoup injuries may be visible on CT as contusions (bruising), though concussion typically occurs without visible imaging changes.',

          'BIOMECHANICS: Grey matter (neuronal cell bodies) and white matter (axons) have different densities and mechanical properties. During rapid head movement, these tissues move at different rates, causing axons to stretch, twist, and tear.',
          'SEVERITY SPECTRUM: DAI exists on a continuum from mild (concussion) to severe (coma, persistent vegetative state). Mild DAI is the underlying pathology in most concussions, while severe DAI causes prolonged unconsciousness.',
          'ANATOMICAL DISTRIBUTION: Common sites include corpus callosum, corona radiata, internal capsule, brainstem, and grey-white matter junctions. These regions have high concentrations of parallel axonal fibers vulnerable to shearing.',
          'TEMPORAL EVOLUTION: Primary axotomy (immediate tearing) occurs at injury moment. Secondary axonal injury progresses over hours to days due to disrupted axonal transport, calcium influx, and inflammatory cascades.',

          'BIOMECHANICS: The same forces causing concussion (rapid acceleration-deceleration) affect cervical structures: muscles, ligaments, facet joints, and intervertebral discs. The head\'s weight (4-5 kg) creates significant leverage on the neck during impact.',
          'CLINICAL OVERLAP: Cervical dysfunction can mimic or exacerbate concussion symptoms including headache, dizziness, visual disturbances, and cognitive difficulties. This overlap makes differential diagnosis challenging.',
          'VESTIBULAR CONNECTION: Cervical proprioceptors provide critical input to vestibular system for balance and spatial orientation. Disrupted cervical proprioception contributes to dizziness and balance problems post-concussion.',

          'PREVALENCE: Approximately 10-20% of individuals experience symptoms persisting beyond 4 weeks. In pediatric populations, rates may be slightly higher (15-30%) depending on definition and population studied.',
          'NATURAL HISTORY: Most individuals with PPCS show gradual improvement over 3-12 months with appropriate management. However, 2-5% may have symptoms lasting >1 year. Prognosis worsens with delayed diagnosis, lack of treatment, and psychosocial stressors.',

          'PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS: Migraine headaches (strongest predictor—3-5x increased risk), anxiety/depression, ADHD, learning disabilities, chronic pain conditions, and sleep disorders all increase PPCS risk. These conditions may be exacerbated by concussion or mimic PPCS symptoms.',

Age extremes (young children, older adults) may have prolonged recovery. Lower socioeconomic status correlates with worse outcomes, likely due to access to care.',

          'VESTIBULAR REHABILITATION: For vestibular-ocular phenotype (positive VOMS, dizziness, imbalance). Gaze stabilization exercises (VOR x1, VOR x2), habituation exercises for motion sensitivity, balance training. Typically 4-8 weeks of therapy. 70-80% success rate when vestibular dysfunction properly identified.',

Manual therapy for C1-C2 dysfunction, proprioceptive retraining (joint position sense exercises), deep neck flexor strengthening, postural correction. Often combined with vestibular rehab if both present.',

Daily 20-30 minute sessions of sub-symptom threshold aerobic exercise. Improves autonomic function, cerebral blood flow, mood, and sleep. Strong evidence for persistent symptoms (Leddy et al., 2018).',
          'VISION THERAPY: For convergence insufficiency (NPC >6 cm), accommodation dysfunction, or oculomotor abnormalities. Near-far focus exercises, pencil push-ups, computerized vision training. Referral to optometrist or neuro-ophthalmologist specializing in concussion.',
          'MIGRAINE MANAGEMENT: If post-traumatic migraine phenotype (pulsating headache, photophobia, phonophobia, nausea). Lifestyle modifications (hydration, regular meals, sleep hygiene, trigger avoidance). Acute treatment (triptans if true migraine characteristics). Preventive medication if frequent headaches (amitriptyline, topiramate, propranolol). Avoid medication overuse.',
          'COGNITIVE REHABILITATION: Graduated return to cognitive activities with pacing strategies, environmental modifications (quiet room, frequent breaks, reduced screen time), organizational tools (planners, reminders). Formal cognitive rehabilitation if specific deficits identified on neuropsych testing. Most cognitive symptoms improve as other symptoms resolve.',
          'PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for mood symptoms, catastrophic thinking, fear-avoidance, and poor coping strategies. Address anxiety and depression proactively—strong evidence these prolong recovery if untreated. Mindfulness-based stress reduction may help with pain and stress management.',

          'HISTORICAL CONTEXT: First described as "punch drunk syndrome" or "dementia pugilistica" in boxers in 1920s-1930s. Modern understanding emerged from McKee et al. neuropathological studies in 2000s showing CTE in American football players and other contact sport athletes.',
          'CRITICAL DISTINCTION: CTE is NOT the same as PPCS. CTE is a neuropathological diagnosis (tau protein deposition) that can only be definitively diagnosed post-mortem. PPCS is a clinical syndrome following acute concussion. Having a concussion does not mean you will develop CTE.',
          'EPIDEMIOLOGY & PREVALENCE: True prevalence unknown because: (1) Diagnosis requires autopsy, (2) Brain donation biased toward symptomatic individuals, (3) No population-based studies. Studies of brain donors (biased sample) show CTE in ~20% of contact sport athletes, but this vastly overestimates true prevalence in all athletes.',
          'RISK FACTORS: Length of exposure to contact sports (years played), level of play (professional > collegiate > high school), position (linemen in football, enforcers in hockey at higher risk), repetitive subconcussive impacts may contribute more than diagnosed concussions. APOE ε4 allele may increase susceptibility. Age of first exposure remains controversial.',

Differs from Alzheimer\'s disease (different tau distribution pattern, β-amyloid plaques absent or minimal in CTE).',
          'PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS (Hypothesized): Repetitive mechanical forces → axonal injury → disrupted axonal transport → tau accumulation and misfolding → spread of pathological tau (prion-like propagation) → neuroinflammation → neurodegeneration → progressive brain atrophy. Exact mechanisms remain unclear.',
          'STAGES OF PATHOLOGY (McKee et al.): Stage I - Isolated foci of p-tau in frontal cortex. Stage II - More widespread p-tau in frontal/temporal lobes, some hippocampal involvement. Stage III - Widespread p-tau, hippocampal atrophy, septal abnormalities. Stage IV - Severe widespread p-tau, marked atrophy, depigmentation of substantia nigra.',
          'CLINICAL PRESENTATION (Proposed—Not Validated): Early symptoms (20s-30s) - mood changes (depression, anxiety, apathy), behavioral changes (impulsivity, aggression, suicidality), cognitive complaints (memory, attention). Late symptoms (40s-60s) - progressive cognitive decline, dementia, parkinsonism, speech/gait problems. However, clinical-pathological correlation is WEAK—many with neuropathological CTE were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms.',
          'DIAGNOSTIC CHALLENGES: (1) No validated in-vivo diagnostic test, (2) Proposed clinical criteria (research only, not clinically validated), (3) Symptoms overlap with many other conditions (depression, ADHD, substance abuse, normal aging, other dementias), (4) Tau PET imaging shows promise but cannot yet distinguish CTE from other tauopathies, (5) Cannot predict who will develop CTE based on exposure history.',
