          'DEFINITION: A concussion is a complex pathophysiological process affecting the brain, induced by biomechanical forces. It is a functional disturbance rather than structural injury, which is why standard CT and MRI scans typically appear normal.',
          'CLASSIFICATION: Concussion is categorized as a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), representing 70-90% of all TBI cases. However, the term "mild" refers to initial presentation, not severity of symptoms or long-term impact.',
          'EPIDEMIOLOGY: Estimated 1.6 to 3.8 million sports-related concussions occur annually in the United States, with actual incidence likely higher due to underreporting. In Australia, approximately 180,000 concussions occur annually across all settings (sports, workplace, motor vehicle accidents, falls).',
          'GLOBAL BURDEN: Concussion affects all age groups, from pediatric athletes to elderly fall victims. The socioeconomic impact includes healthcare costs, lost productivity, and reduced quality of life. Understanding concussion mechanisms is essential for prevention, diagnosis, and management.',

          'The brain, suspended in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), moves independently of the skull during rapid head motion. This differential movement creates shearing forces on neural tissue.',
          'Four primary mechanisms contribute to concussion injury: (1) Rotational/Angular forces, (2) Linear/Translational forces, (3) Coup-Contrecoup injuries, and (4) Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI). Each mechanism has distinct biomechanical properties and clinical implications.',

          '🔄 MECHANISM: Rotational acceleration occurs when the head rotates around its center of mass. This creates angular momentum and shearing stresses throughout brain tissue.',
          'BIOMECHANICS: The brain\'s outer cortex and inner structures rotate at different velocities due to varying densities and attachment points. This differential rotation stretches and tears axons, particularly at grey-white matter junctions.',
          'CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Rotational forces are considered the most damaging mechanism in concussion. Even without direct head contact, rapid rotation can cause severe injury (e.g., whiplash-associated concussion).',
          'EXAMPLES: Boxing hook punch, rugby tackle causing head rotation, car accident with lateral impact, rotational fall in elderly.',
          'FORCE THRESHOLD: Research suggests rotational accelerations >4500-6000 rad/s² can produce concussion, though individual thresholds vary significantly.',

          'BIOMECHANICS: The skull accelerates rapidly while the brain lags behind due to inertia, then catches up and may impact the inner skull surface. This creates compression and tension forces.',
          'CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Linear forces alone rarely cause concussion unless extremely high magnitude. Most real-world concussions involve combined linear and rotational forces.',
          'EXAMPLES: Direct frontal impact in motor vehicle accident, fall directly onto back of head, frontal collision in contact sports.',
          'FORCE THRESHOLD: Linear accelerations >60-100g (where g = 9.8 m/s²) may produce concussion, though threshold varies by impact duration and location.',

          '💥 MECHANISM: Coup injury occurs at the site of direct impact. Contrecoup injury occurs on the opposite side of the brain due to rebound forces.',
          'BIOMECHANICS: Upon impact, the skull deforms slightly and compresses underlying brain tissue (coup). The brain then moves away from impact site and may strike the opposite side of the skull (contrecoup). Negative pressure at the coup site and positive pressure at contrecoup site create cavitation and tissue damage.',
          'CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Contrecoup injuries can be more severe than coup injuries due to the brain\'s movement properties and skull anatomy. The frontal and temporal lobes are particularly vulnerable to contrecoup damage when impact occurs to the occiput.',
          'EXAMPLES: Fall backward onto occiput causing frontal lobe contrecoup injury, frontal impact causing occipital contrecoup.',
          'IMAGING CORRELATION: Coup and contrecoup injuries may be visible on CT as contusions (bruising), though concussion typically occurs without visible imaging changes.',

          'BIOMECHANICS: Grey matter (neuronal cell bodies) and white matter (axons) have different densities and mechanical properties. During rapid head movement, these tissues move at different rates, causing axons to stretch, twist, and tear.',
          'SEVERITY SPECTRUM: DAI exists on a continuum from mild (concussion) to severe (coma, persistent vegetative state). Mild DAI is the underlying pathology in most concussions, while severe DAI causes prolonged unconsciousness.',
          'ANATOMICAL DISTRIBUTION: Common sites include corpus callosum, corona radiata, internal capsule, brainstem, and grey-white matter junctions. These regions have high concentrations of parallel axonal fibers vulnerable to shearing.',

Stage III - Widespread p-tau, hippocampal atrophy, septal abnormalities. Stage IV - Severe widespread p-tau, marked atrophy, depigmentation of substantia nigra.',
