**Return-to-Learn (RTL) Strategy** (Green header)

Facilitating RTL is a vital part of the recovery process for student-athletes. HCPs should work with stakeholders on education and school policies to facilitate academic support. Not all athletes will need a RTL strategy or academic support. If symptoms exacerbate during cognitive activity or screen time, or if there is a history of learning concerns, consider implementing a RTL strategy at diagnosis. Progression should be symptom limited.

| Step | Mental Activity | Activity at Each Step | Goal |
|------|-----------------|----------------------|------|
| 1 | Daily activities that do not result in more than a mild exacerbation* of symptoms related to the current concussion. | Typical activities during the day (e.g., reading) while minimizing screen time. Start with 5–15 min at a time and increase gradually. | Gradual return to typical activities. |
| 2 | School activities. | Homework, reading, or other cognitive activities outside of the classroom. | Increase tolerance to cognitive work. |
| 3 | Return to school part time. | Gradual introduction of schoolwork. May need to start with a partial school day or with greater access to rest breaks during the day. | Increase academic activities. |
| 4 | Return to school full time. | Gradually progress school activities until a full day can be tolerated without more than mild* symptom exacerbation. | Return to full academic activities and catch up on missed work. |

**NOTE:** Following an initial period of relative rest (24-48 hours following injury at Step 1), athletes can begin a gradual and incremental increase in their cognitive load. Progression through the strategy for students should be slowed when there is more than a mild and brief symptom exacerbation.

*Mild and brief exacerbation of symptoms is defined as an increase of no more than 2 points on a 0-10 point scale (with 0 representing no symptoms and 10 the worst symptoms imaginable) for less than an hour when compared with the baseline value reported prior to cognitive activity.

### Page 15: RTS Strategy

**Return-to-Sport (RTS) Strategy** (Green header)

Return to sport participation after an SRC follows a graduated stepwise strategy. RTS occurs in conjunction with and under the supervision of an HCP. Following an initial period of relative rest, clinicians can implement Step 2, light (Step 2A) and then moderate (Step 2B) aerobic activity; of the RTS strategy as a treatment for acute concussion. The athlete should not advance to later stages of the RTS strategy by symptoms, cognitive function, clinical findings, and clinical judgement. Differentiating early activity (step 1), aerobic exercise (Step 2), and individual sport-specific exercise (Step 3) as part of the progression of Steps 2-4 may be useful for the athlete and their support network. Medical determination of readiness, including psychological readiness, to return to at-risk activities should occur prior to returning to any activities at risk of contact, collision or fall. Athletes may be moved into the later stages that involve full or part contact (Steps 4-6 and Step 5) if there are no new risk of head impact. Unrestricted RTS should only occur when the athlete has successfully navigated to and in keeping with local laws/requirements.

| Step | Exercise Strategy | Activity at Each Step | Goal |
|------|------------------|----------------------|------|
| 1 | Symptom-limited activity. | Daily activities that do not exacerbate symptoms (e.g., walking). | Gradual reintroduction of work/school. |
| 2 | Aerobic exercise: **2A – Light** (up to approx. 55% max HR) **then 2B – Moderate** (up to approximately 70% max HR) | Stationary cycling or walking at slow to medium pace. May start light resistance training that does not result in more than mild and brief exacerbation* of concussion symptoms. | Increase heart rate. |
| 3 | Individual sport-specific exercise. **NOTE:** If sport-specific exercise involves any risk of head impact, medical determination of readiness to RTS should occur prior to step 3. | Sport-specific training away from the team environment (e.g., running, change of direction and/or individual training drills away from the team environment). No activities at risk of head impact. | Add movement, change of direction. |

**Steps 4-6 should begin after resolution of any symptoms, abnormalities in cognitive function, and any other clinical findings related to the current concussion, including with and after physical exertion.**

| Step | Exercise Strategy | Activity at Each Step | Goal |
|------|------------------|----------------------|------|
| 4 | Non-contact training drills. | Exercise to high intensity including more challenging training drills (e.g., passing drills, multiplayer training). Can integrate into team environment. | Resume usual intensity of exercise, coordination, and increased thinking. |
| 5 | Full contact practice. | Participate in normal training activities. | Restore confidence and assess functional skills by coaching staff. |
| 6 | Return to sport. | Normal game play. | |

**maxHR = predicted maximal Heart Rate according to age (i.e., 220-age)**

| Age Predicted Maximal HR= 220-age | Mild Aerobic Exercise | Moderate Aerobic Exercise |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| 55% | 220-age x 0.55 = training target HR | |
| 70% | | 220-age x 0.70 = training target HR |

**NOTE:** *Mild and brief exacerbation of symptoms (i.e., an increase of no more than 2 points on a 0-10 point scale for less than an hour when compared with the baseline value reported prior to physical activity). Athletes who initiate Steps 1-3 within 24 hours of injury, with progression through each subsequent step typically taking a minimum of 24 hours. If more than mild exacerbation of symptoms occurs during Steps 4-6, they should return to Step 3 to establish full resolution of symptoms with exertion before engaging in at-risk activities. Written determination of readiness to RTS should be provided by an HCP before unrestricted RTS as directed by local laws and/or sporting regulations.
